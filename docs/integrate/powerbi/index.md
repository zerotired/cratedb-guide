:::{rubric} About
:::

[Power BI Desktop] is a powerful business intelligence tool that provides a set of
data analytics and visualizations. Using Power BI Desktop, users can create reports
and dashboards from large datasets.

:::{dropdown} **Details**
For connecting to CrateDB with Power BI, you can use the [Power Query PostgreSQL connector].
Earlier versions used the [PostgreSQL ODBC driver]. [](project:#powerbi-desktop) walks
you through the process of configuring that correctly.

[Power BI Service] is an online data analysis and visualization tool, making it
possible to publish your dashboards, in order to share them with others.
{ref}`powerbi-service` has a corresponding usage guide.
